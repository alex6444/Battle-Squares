# Battle-Squares
A battle arena game that I made while at the AIE 

This is a simple battle arena game within squares and users take turns picking squares to go on. Each square triggers an event.
The events give or take away user points depending on how they react to them. 

This game is far from complete and is a project I'd deeply love to fix up at some point and even potentionally expand.
